# Keploy Typescript-SDK
This is the client SDK for the [Keploy](https://github.com/keploy/keploy) testing platform. With the TypeScript SDK, you can test both your existing unit test cases in Jest and create new end-to-end test cases for your applications.
The **HTTP mocks/stubs and tests are the same format** and inter-exchangeable.

## Installation
1. First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Then,
```bash
# for npm package manager
npm i @keploy/sdk
```
```bash
# for yarn package manager
yarn add @keploy/sdk
```

2. Install and Start the keploy binary on an independent terminal. Follow [this](https://github.com/keploy/keploy#quick-installation) guide

3. Finally, install nyc as a development dependency using npm or yarn:
```bash
# for npm package manager
npm install --save-dev nyc
```
```bash
# for yarn package manager
yarn add --dev nyc
```
With nyc installed, you can now use it to analyze code coverage for both unit and end-to-end test cases in your project

## Usage
### Unit and End-to-End Testing with Keploy
Keploy simplifies the testing process by seamlessly generating end-to-end test cases without the need to write unit test files and manage mocks/stubs.

 1. **Enabling Coverage** 
    To add the specified coverage-related scripts to your <b>package.json</b> file, you can include the following statement within the "scripts" section:
    ``` bash
            "scripts": {
                // ... other scripts
                "test": "jest --coverage",
                "coverage": "nyc npm test && npm run coverage:merge && npm run coverage:report",
                "coverage:merge": "mkdir -p ./coverage && nyc merge ./coverage .nyc_output/out.json",
                "coverage:report": "nyc report --reporter=lcov --reporter=text"
                // ... other scripts
            }
    ```
 2. **A testfile to run and display coverage**
    Create a test file that execute Keploy's end-to-end test cases along with unit testcases.  It can be called as ```Keploy.test.js```

    The contents of the file will be
    ```bash
        const { expect } = require('@jest/globals');
        const keploy = require('@keploy/sdk');
        const timeOut = 300000;

        describe('Keploy Server Tests', () => {
            test('TestKeploy', (done) => {
                const cmd = 'npm start';
                const options = {};
                keploy.Test(cmd, options, (err, res) => { 
                    if (err) {
                        done(err);
                    } else {
                        expect(res).toBeTruthy(); // Assert the test result
                        done();
                    }
                });
            }, timeOut);
        }, timeOut);
    ```
3. **RunOptions**
    
    ```bash
        options {
            delay: number; // delay for the application ro run
            debug: boolean; // enable or disable debug flag
            port: number; // port of keploy you want to run
            path: string; // path of the keploy tests and mocks
        }
    ```
    
4. **Test** 
    Execute
    ```bash
        keploy test -c "npm test" --delay 10 --coverage
    ```

5. **Get Combined coverage**
    Execute
    ```bash
        keploy test -c "npm run coverage" --delay 10 --coverage
    ```

ðŸŽ‰TADA: You've successfully tested end-to-end test cases alongside unit test cases without the need to write additional test files or manage mocks/stubs.
