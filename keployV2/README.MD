# Keploy Typescript-SDK
This is the client SDK for the [Keploy](https://github.com/keploy/keploy) testing platform. With the TypeScript SDK, you can test both your existing unit test cases in Jest and create new end-to-end test cases for your applications.
The **HTTP mocks/stubs and tests are the same format** and inter-exchangeable.

## Installation
1. First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Then,
```bash
# for npm package manager
npm i @keploy/typescript-sdk
```
```bash
# for yarn package manager
yarn add @keploy/typescript-sdk
```

2. Install and Start the keploy binary on an independent terminal. Follow [this](https://github.com/keploy/keploy#quick-installation) guide

3. Finally, install nyc as a development dependency using npm or yarn:
```bash
# for npm package manager
npm install --save-dev nyc
```
```bash
# for yarn package manager
yarn add --dev nyc
```
With nyc installed, you can now use it to analyze code coverage for both unit and end-to-end test cases in your project

## Usage
### Unit and End-to-End Testing with Keploy
Keploy simplifies the testing process by seamlessly generating end-to-end test cases without the need to write unit test files and manage mocks/stubs.

 1. **Enabling Coverage** 
    To add the specified coverage-related scripts to your <b>package.json</b> file, you can include the following statement within the "scripts" section:
    ``` bash
            "scripts": {
                // ... other scripts
                "test": "jest",
                "coverage": "nyc npm test && npm run coverage:merge && npm run coverage:report",
                "coverage:merge": "nyc merge ./coverage .nyc_output/out.json",
                "coverage:report": "nyc report --reporter=lcov --reporter=text",
                // ... other scripts
            }
    ```
 2. **A testfile to run and display coverage**
    Create a test file that execute Keploy's end-to-end test cases along with unit testcases.  It can be called as ```Keploy.test.js```

    The contents of the file will be
    ```bash
        const {
            FetchTestSets,
            RunTestSet,
            FetchTestSetStatus,
            TestRunStatus,
            StopUserApplication,
            StartUserApplication,
        } = require('@keploy/typescript-sdk/dist/keployV2/keployCli');
        const { expect } = require('@jest/globals');
        describe('Keploy Server Tests', () => {
            test('TestKeploy', async () => {
                let testResult = true;
                const MAX_TIMEOUT = 10000;
                let startTime = Date.now();
                try {
                    const testSets = await FetchTestSets();
                    if (testSets === null) {
                        throw new Error('Test sets are null');
                    }
                    console.log("TestSets: ", [...testSets]);
                    console.log("starting user application");
                    for (let testset of testSets) {
                        let result = true;
                        console.log(testset,"testsset")
                        StartUserApplication(<commandToStartUserApplication>)
                        const testRunId = await RunTestSet(testset);
                        let testRunStatus;
                        while (true) {
                            await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 10000));
                            testRunStatus = await FetchTestSetStatus(testRunId);
                            if (testRunStatus === TestRunStatus.RUNNING) {
                                console.log("testRun still in progress");
                                if (Date.now() - startTime > MAX_TIMEOUT) {
                                    console.log("Timeout reached, exiting loop");
                                    break;
                                }
                                continue;
                            }
                            break;
                        }

                        if (testRunStatus === TestRunStatus.FAILED || testRunStatus === TestRunStatus.RUNNING) {
                            console.log("testrun failed");
                            result = false;
                        } else if (testRunStatus === TestRunStatus.PASSED) {
                            console.log("testrun passed");
                            result = true;
                        }
                        console.log(`TestResult of [${testset}]: ${result}`);
                        testResult = testResult && result;
                        StopUserApplication()
                    }
                } catch (error) {
                    throw error;
                }
                expect(testResult).toBeTruthy();

            }, 300000);
        }, 300000);
    ```
    Replace ```<commandToStartUserApplication>``` with the command to start the application.

3. **Test** 
    Execute
    ```bash
        keploy serve -c "npm test" --delay 10
    ```

ðŸŽ‰TADA: You've successfully tested end-to-end test cases alongside unit test cases without the need to write additional test files or manage mocks/stubs.
