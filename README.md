# Keploy Typescript-SDK
[Keploy](https://keploy.io) is a no-code testing platform that generates tests from API calls. This is the Typescript client SDK for recording and replaying the API Calls. There are 2 modes:
1. **Record mode**
    1. Record requests, response and sends to Keploy server.
    2. After keploy server removes duplicates, it then runs the request on the API again to identify noisy fields.
    3. Sends the noisy fields to the keploy server to be saved along with the testcase.
2. **Test mode**
    1. Fetches testcases for the app from keploy server.
    2. Calls the API with same request payload in testcase.
    3. Validates the respones and uploads results to the keploy server.

## Installation
```bash
npm i https://github.com/keploy/typescript-sdk
```

## Usage

```js
require("typescript-sdk/dist/integrations/express/register");
```
## Configure
```
export KEPLOY_MODE="test"
export KEPLOY_APP_NAME="my-app"
export KEPLOY_APP_HOST="localhost"
export KEPLOY_APP_PORT=5050 # port on which server is running
export KEPLOY_APP_DELAY=5 # time delay before starting testruns(in seconds)
export KEPLOY_APP_TIMEOUT=100 # should be number
# export KEPLOY_APP_FILTER={"urlRegex":"*"}  # should be json not to capture for certain url's

export KEPLOY_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8081/api" # self hosted keploy running server
# export KEPLOY_SERVER_LICENSE="XXX-XXX-XXX" # hosted keploy server api key
```
### KEPLOY_MODE
There are 3 modes:
 - **Record**: Sets to record mode.
 - **Test**: Sets to test mode.
 - **Off**: Turns off all the functionality provided by the API

**Note:** `KEPLOY_MODE` value is case sensitive.

## Supported Frameworks
### 1. Express
```js
require("typescript-sdk/dist/integrations/express/register");
```
#### Example
```js
require("typescript-sdk/dist/integrations/express/register");
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 5050;

app.use(express.json());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({"field": "App is healthy", "opacity": Math.random()})
})

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port: ${port}`);
})
```
## Development Setup

- This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management. To install yarn, please make sure [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed and then:

```sh
npm i -g yarn
```

- To install local dependencies, assuming you are at root of the project:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Integration with Mocha testing framework
You just need to do some imports and call a built-in assert function in your code in your unit test file and that's it!!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
```js
const {runServer} = require('../server') //your server wrapper
const {keploy}  = require('typescript-sdk/dist/integrations/express/register')
const {describe,test,before,after}=  require('mocha')
describe("test function", ()=>{
    before( (done)=>{
            keploy.setTestMode();
            runServer()
            done()
          })
    test("should be running", async ()=> {
      await keploy.assertTests();
    });
    after(()=>{
         process.exit(1); //exits the node server
       })
})
```
Note:- To see code coverage please use nyc mocha and see how many lines are covered!!


- Furthermore, to commit your changes use `yarn commit` instead of `git commit` for better commit experience.

- For VSCode setup, make sure these extensions are installed:
  - [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
  - [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
