# Keploy
[Keploy](https://keploy.io) is a no-code testing platform that generates tests from API calls.

## Development Setup

- This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management. To install yarn, please make sure [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed and then:

```sh
npm i -g yarn
```

- To install local dependencies, assuming you are at root of the project:

```sh
yarn install
```

- Furthermore, to commit your changes use `yarn commit` instead of `git commit` for better commit experiance.

- For VSCode setup, make sure these extensions are installed:
